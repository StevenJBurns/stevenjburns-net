    <p>NOTE: My site uses a lot of the most current technology in its design. You may not be able to see certain portions of it depending on your web browser, its current settings, and whether certain add-ins, plug-ins, components and/or controls are on your machine. Additionally there are large graphic and sound files so don't be a loser and stop downloading the files before they're done or else you've undermined my hard work. If your modem has bandwidth envy be prepared to wait. In short, the site has been tested and it works. Any senseless, needless whining that it or any of the links don't work simply means you are technologically challenged and/or your computer is as well. Reconfigure your system, download the appropriate software or go buy a better computer -- just don't say its my fault... I've already been married once and heard that enough...</p>

      <span>Buenos tacos... some how, some way you've ended up here. I figure a personal web page is kind of like a mini-biography that roughly tells you what a person is all about. If this is true then you'll see I'm nothing more than a 8 year old kid trapped in a 28 year old body. In some cases there are just bigger and better toys...</span>
